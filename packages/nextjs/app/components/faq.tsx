    question: "How is the value of each $XOC backed?",
    answer:
      "Each $XOC is backed by an ERC20 token on the Polygon, Gnosis Chain, and Optimism networks. This backing ensures that each $XOC can be liquidated for its equivalent value in $XOC-denominated debt and settle the account in the process, all backed by the network of validators.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can I do with $XOC?",
    answer:
      "You can use $XOC to pay off debts, acquire goods and services, or simply hold it as a store of value, much like any other Mexican peso. Additionally, you can support the La DAO community by building the next open and decentralized financial system.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who maintains all this?",
    answer:
      "We utilize a business model based on a DAO, currently known as 'La DAO.' This decentralized autonomous organization is responsible for managing all the work needed to build in DeFi.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I get involved?",
    answer:
      "You can acquire $XOC on any exchange that offers it, or participate in the DAO and contribute to building the future of decentralized finance. If you have skills you think may be useful, feel free to reach out to us.",
