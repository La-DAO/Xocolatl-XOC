  "CDPParagraph1": "Our platform leverages a set of smart contracts to manage the deposit, minting, and withdrawal processes. When you deposit assets into our smart contract, these assets are securely held and serve as collateral for minting new stablecoins. The smart contracts ensure the safety and integrity of your assets by enforcing strict rules and conditions.",
  "CDPInfoSubtitle2": "The Mechanism of Depositing and Minting",
  "CDPParagraph2": "When you deposit assets into the smart contract, you are essentially locking up collateral. Based on the value of this collateral, you can mint a corresponding amount of stablecoins. For example, if you deposit 1 ETH worth $2000, and the collateralization ratio is 150%, you can mint up to $1333 worth of stablecoins. The system constantly monitors the value of the collateral to ensure it remains sufficient to back the minted stablecoins.",
