The Assets Accountant then allows you to mint up to ~80% of your asset‚Äôs value in $XOC to your wallet. $XOC is created (minted) at the current MXN/USD rate which can then be used in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis allows builders, creators, and entrepreneurs to leverage their assets to create new value and opportunities.",

  "CDPInfoTitle": "Understanding the CDP Mechanism",
  "CDPInfoSubtitle": "How the Contracts Work",
  "CDPParagraph1": "Our platform leverages a set of smart contracts to manage the deposit, minting, and withdrawal processes. When you deposit assets into our smart contract, these assets are securely held and serve as collateral for minting new stablecoins. The smart contracts ensure the safety and integrity of your assets by enforcing strict rules and conditions.",
  "CDPInfoSubtitle2": "The Mechanism of Depositing and Minting",
  "CDPParagraph2": "When you deposit assets into the smart contract, you are essentially locking up collateral. Based on the value of this collateral, you can mint a corresponding amount of stablecoins. For example, if you deposit 1 ETH worth $2000, and the collateralization ratio is 150%, you can mint up to $1333 worth of stablecoins. The system constantly monitors the value of the collateral to ensure it remains sufficient to back the minted stablecoins.",

  "CDPInfoStep1": "You deposit your assets into the smart contract.",
  "CDPInfoStep2": "The smart contract calculates the maximum amount of stablecoins you can mint based on the collateral value and the required collateralization ratio.",
