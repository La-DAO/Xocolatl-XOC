      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        The “Xocolatl smart contracts” are open-source software programs deployed on a blockchain network, facilitating
        the minting of an over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to the MXN peso (“XOC”). Xocolatl Finance provides
        software interfaces that allow users to interact with the Xocolatl smart contracts. The primary purpose of the
        Site is to enable access to Xocolatl smart contracts and to provide relevant resources, including developer
        documentation, examples, and other Services related to Xocolatl.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        Some Services offered by Xocolatl Finance or others within the Xocolatl ecosystem require payment or involve the
        use of blockchain infrastructure (“Distributed Ledger Technology”), which may incur fees, such as “gas” fees.
        You acknowledge that Xocolatl Finance has no control over transactions on the Distributed Ledger Technology,
        payment methods, or the actual completion of payments. Ensure you have a sufficient balance of blockchain
        network tokens at your address compatible with the Distributed Ledger Technology before initiating transactions.

      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        Xocolatl Finance and its affiliates will not be held responsible for any incidental, indirect, or consequential
        damages related to using the Site, Services, or the Xocolatl Network, including loss of data, revenue, or other
        business or financial benefits. This applies to all possible legal theories, whether or not Xocolatl Finance was
        aware of potential damages, and remains in force even if any limited remedy fails.

      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">9. Release</h2>
      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        By using the Site and Services, users release Xocolatl Finance and its affiliates from past, present, and future
        claims related to interactions on the platform, including disputes with other users or third-party services.
        This release includes a waiver of any protections under laws that might otherwise prohibit releasing unknown

      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">10. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        Disputes with Xocolatl Finance must be resolved through individual arbitration under JAMS Rules in California,
        unless specifically exempted, such as for small claims. Class actions, class arbitrations, and representative
        actions are prohibited. Users are required to attempt informal resolution by contacting Xocolatl Finance before
        proceeding to arbitration. Either party can appeal arbitration awards only in the courts of the Cayman Islands.
        Users may opt out of arbitration within 30 days by providing written notice. If arbitration terms are found
        unenforceable for public injunctive relief, claims can proceed in civil court but remain stayed pending
        individual arbitration.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        California law governs these Terms, excluding conflict of law rules. Intellectual property enforcement may be
        pursued in any appropriate jurisdiction, but other legal matters outside arbitration will be under Cayman
        Islands jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <hr className="my-6" />
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">12. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p className="text-base mb-4">
        Xocolatl Finance retains any rights not specifically waived under these Terms, and its delay in exercising any
        right does not constitute a waiver. Any provision found invalid does not affect the rest of the Terms. Xocolatl
        Finance is not liable for issues due to external events beyond its control, such as natural disasters or
        government actions. Users cannot transfer their rights without Xocolatl Finance&apos;s consent, while Xocolatl
        Finance may freely assign its rights. These Terms comprise the entire agreement, superseding all prior
        understandings, and if there’s a conflict with another agreement, these Terms will control unless otherwise
        specified. Xocolatl Finance may sell XOC tokens occasionally for corporate purposes.
