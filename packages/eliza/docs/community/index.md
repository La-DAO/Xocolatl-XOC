# Welcome to the ai16z / ElizaOS Community

ai16z is a pioneering venture capital firm that operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize investment strategies and foster an open-source community around AI agents.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to drive innovation at the intersection of AI and blockchain technology by harnessing the collective intelligence of our community and the capabilities of cutting-edge AI agents. We aim to make informed investment decisions, support groundbreaking projects, and accelerate the development and adoption of AI across various domains.

## The ElizaOS Framework

At the core of ai16z lies ElizaOS, an open-source framework designed for creating, deploying, and managing AI agents. These agents, known as "elizas," are versatile entities capable of engaging across various platforms, including Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.

With ElizaOS, developers can:

- Build flexible agents with unique personalities and behaviors
- Leverage modular design to enhance agents with specialized "actions"
- Scale with ease by creating multi-agent systems
- Develop with accessibility using an extensible framework

ElizaOS empowers developers of all skill levels to harness the potential of AI agent technology and contribute to the advancement of the ai16z ecosystem.

## Governance

ai16z originates as being an AI agent led DAO. Similar to how we can influence the autonomous agents on memecoins to buy, we intend to bring similar functionality for token holders to actively participate in the decision-making process and shape the future of the project. Community members can pitch ideas, provide insights, and influence investment strategies based on their expertise and track record.
