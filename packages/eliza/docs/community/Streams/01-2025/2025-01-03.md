**From DeFi to Social Media: Builders Share Progress on AI Agents and Platform Integrations**

- Date: 2025-01-03

## Summary

**Structure and Format:**

*   The space was hosted by Jin (on @ai16zdao) and co-hosted by Shaw, who was initially facing audio issues.
*   It followed a 2-minute round format for updates, focusing on accomplishments related to open-source AI or AI agents.
*   Participants were encouraged to comment below the post if they couldn't speak.
*   A separate demo day was planned for projects needing screen sharing.

**Key Updates and Themes:**

*   **Agent Development and Deployment:** A significant portion of the updates focused on developing, refining, and deploying AI agents. Many participants used the Eliza framework, but others were creating their own frameworks.
*   **Platform Integration**: Many participants were focused on integrating their agents into specific platforms like Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and web apps, including new platforms like modes and base.
*   **Focus on User Experience:** A common theme was making AI agents user-friendly and accessible to those without coding experience. Many were creating tools or platforms for others to easily create, deploy, and use AI agents.
*   **AI-Driven Content Generation:** Several developers were building agents focused on media creation, including songs, videos, and images, as well as content creation from Twitter posts and Github repos.
*   **Integration of Financial Systems:** Several people were developing agents for trading and financial management, including integrations with DeFi protocols.
*   **Security and Auditing:** Some projects focused on using AI for Web3 security, including auditing smart contracts and creating security tools.
*   **Community and Open Source:** Several people mentioned the importance of the community and open source aspect for their projects.
*   **The Importance of Social Media Marketing:** Several people discussed how AI and agents should be a core part of your marketing and product strategy going forward.
*   **Multi-Agent Systems:** Some developers were exploring multi-agent workflows and communication, demonstrating a growing interest in complex AI interactions.
*   **Data Handling and Validation:** Some developers were trying to optimize data gathering, validation, and more precise data handling when working with LLMs.
*   **Real-World Applications:** Some participants were working on real world applications, specifically in the areas of climate change and also fashion and augmented reality.
*   **Integration with Other Services:** Participants were also exploring integration with other services such as Eleven Labs and other web3 protocols like Story Protocol.

**Other Interesting Points:**

*   The hosts are actively exploring ways to integrate more AI agents into their platforms, potentially leading to agent-led spaces.
*   There's a sense of collaborative spirit and willingness to help each other among the community members.
*   The space demonstrated a lot of interest in turning existing tools into agents, as well as building agents from scratch
*   Some participants are attempting to automate parts of the development cycle, especially with planning, PR reviews, and documentation.


## Hot Takes

-   **Web3 and Agent Integration**
    >   "I think getting web 2 people to realize that this is actually just an agent framework you can build apps with is like definitely my goal it doesn't have to be a web3 thing but it's cool that when it is too you know like I think crypto's got a great incentive structure." - *shawmakesmagic* [00:38:17]

-   **AI Marketing Takeover**
    >   "I think that in the future anyone who doesn't have an agent shilling their thing on social media is probably going to have a really hard time marketing their product and I think it's just got to be part of your product strategy now." - *shawmakesmagic* [00:38:48]

-   **Leveraging Developing Countries for AI Labor**
    >   "There is no reason why we cannot leverage the power of people in the third world to build AI agents for us. We in the West are lazy. We have it too easy." - *NEETOCRACY* [01:25:23]

-   **AI Replacing Human Interaction**
    >   "It's gonna be weird when, like, our great-grandchildren are talking to our parents, you know, it's gonna be, like, as, as, like, our ancestors generally, like, you know, that generations of people far down the future will know what we were like because all of our data and our voice and everything about us will be, like, preserved in this kind of agents that they can talk to. It's going to be very interesting." - *shawmakesmagic* [01:18:44]

-   **The Challenges of Getting AI Agents to Work in the Real World**
    >   "But, uh, what ended up happening was messing around with, like, DMs, and DMing people, she got suspended. So basically navigating that whole situation, I was like, you know what, this is actually an opportunity to try some things here." - *O_on_X* [02:27:39]
