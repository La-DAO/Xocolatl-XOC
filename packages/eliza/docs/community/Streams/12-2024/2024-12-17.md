## Notable Quotes

### On ELIZA Framework

> "What's special about what we did was saying, okay, if I have a community of people, and I want Mark to be able to get alpha from those people [...] how do we know who the best trader is? How do we know what information to actually accept?"

### On Developer Accessibility

> "I think most of your average AI dev at Uber is taking the transformer stuff and applying it in their context [...] But most of them even training models is so expensive [...] that most of us end up fine tuning models that we get for free from the large companies."

### On Community Development

> "In the last six weeks, we've gotten external contributions from more than 140 people [...] We get eight pull requests on average a day."

### On Future Vision

> "The reality is that robots and AI will be better than humans at literally every single thing that there is. And there is no escaping that it is just going to happen. How do we live in that world?"

### On AI Trading

> "I really think that the future of this is like AIs are going to invest all of the money. I really think that's like a big part of the future."
