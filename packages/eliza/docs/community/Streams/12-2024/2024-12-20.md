## Summary

This Twitter Spaces "What Did You Get Done This Week? #6" was hosted by ai16z and served as a weekly check-in and accountability forum for developers building AI agents, particularly social agents. The primary focus was on sharing progress made during the week, with an emphasis on completed tasks and shipped features.

**Guidelines:**

The emphasis on open-source development, community collaboration, and shipping products was evident throughout the discussion.

## Quotables

1. **reality_spiral:** "We're often having them seriously consider investing directly with an agent out of their liquid fund." (**00:28:06**)

    - **Controversy:** The idea of traditional investors allocating capital directly to an AI agent, bypassing human fund managers, is radical and challenges established investment practices.

2. **dooly_dev:** "Two, AGI level five matching platform." (**00:47:53**)

    - **Controversy:** While brief, the claim of working on an "AGI level five matching platform" is bold. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) at level five would imply human-level or even superhuman intelligence, a highly debated and ambitious goal. The nature of a "matching platform" in this context is also unclear, adding to the intrigue.

3. **0xnavkumar:** "If any of you have done a lot of work with evaluators, do hit me up. I'd love to ask you a few questions, but that's me." (**00:52:29**)

    - **Controversy:** The speaker is having technical difficulties with Twitter integration and asks for help from other developers on the call. This highlights the challenges and complexities of working with new technologies.

4. **GoatOfGamblers:** "And these AI agents can use this as some kind of hedge mechanism. They bet under, sort of like targeting the coins when they hold the coins or just dump it for a double kill." (**01:15:45**)

    - **Controversy:** This statement describes a potential strategy where AI agents could manipulate the prediction market by betting against coins they hold and then dumping them, potentially harming other investors. This raises ethical concerns about market manipulation by AI.

5. **\_AnonDev:** "I actually forgot that it's Christmas in like four days. I haven't seen sunlight in about a week." (**01:32:30**)

    - **Controversy:** While relatable to some in the tech world, the idea of a developer being so engrossed in their work that they lose track of time and neglect their well-being can be seen as promoting an unhealthy work-life balance, especially during a major holiday.
