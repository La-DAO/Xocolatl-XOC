# DAOs & AI: The Future of On-Chain Coordination

## Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are evolving beyond simple voting mechanisms into complex systems that leverage AI agents for enhanced coordination, decision-making, and resource allocation. This integration represents a fundamental shift in how we think about organizational structure and governance.
