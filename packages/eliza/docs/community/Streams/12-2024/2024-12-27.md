## Summary

This Twitter Space, hosted by ai16z, focused on what participants had accomplished in the realm of open-source AI and social AI agents during the week.

**Key Highlights and Themes:**

- **Decentralized AI in China:** Shaw, who was in Hong Kong, highlighted the "cyberpunk" nature of the decentralized AI scene in China and his positive experiences connecting with developers, academics, and potential partners. He mentioned collaborations on papers about AI, including one on how to erase nudity in images for ethical AI development.
- **Eliza OS Development:** A significant portion of the discussion revolved around the Eliza OS project. Developers shared progress on various aspects, including:
    - **Hyperfi Integration:** Odie talked about integrating Eliza instances with Hyperfi, a 3D metaverse, for multi-agent simulations.
    - **Agentic Documentation and Security:** 0xBuildingPublic discussed creating automated documentation for plugins and a security auditing feature. They proposed a dedicated space for security and auto-documentation.
    - **On-Chain Agent Q:** IQ6900\_ and Im_zo_eth detailed their work on a fully on-chain agent (Agent Q) and technology to significantly reduce the cost of storing data on Ethereum and Solana. They also mentioned exploring technical integration with Eliza OS, aiming to make their API's input and output data fully on-chain.
    - **Minecraft Integration:** yeahimomar described their project of integrating AI agents into Minecraft as villagers, allowing for dynamic interactions and personalities within the game. They suggested creating a Minecraft plugin for Eliza OS.
    - **V2 Development:** Chris Latorres talked about his role in leading the development of Eliza V2, focusing on meetings and coordination with contributors.
    - **GitHub Adapter:** Reality_spiral detailed their work on a "collective, continuous, recursive self-improvement" system where agents can modify their own source code.
    - **Eliza.Gigi:** Improvements to the Eliza.Gigi platform were mentioned, including the ability to query about issues and PRs in the Eliza repository.
- **Trading and Finance:** FilteredThought presented an end-to-end trading system using the TrustDB, and discussed creating an open-source "Alexa" using a local LLM and voice model. GoatOfGamblers talked about a prediction market using memecoin prices, and TriadFi described their prediction market on Solana with a "balance share" agent.
- **Social and Community Building:** AffaanMustafa emphasized the importance of social media and brand building, sharing his positive experience with live-coding streams. The concept of a "consortium" for Eliza OS was introduced, suggesting a collaborative approach involving multiple teams.
- **Partnerships and Collaboration:** The restart of partnerships was announced, with a focus on deeper collaboration among contributors.
- **Tokenomics:** The tokenomics proposal was released for community feedback, and work on this aspect was mentioned by ai16zdao.
- **Other Projects:**
    - **Spore:** hashwarlock discussed their project, Spore, involving an AI agent swarm and the concept of "rug-proof money."
    - **SoulScript:** r4dicalcentrism introduced SoulScript, a framework for defining mutable agent personalities.
    - **Dark Sun:** 0xblacksun detailed their project, Dark Sun, an "internet detective" agent that's building an agentic-based Wikipedia and integrating with on-chain data storage. They also mentioned exploring the preservation of endangered languages.
    - **Infinite Region AI:** tmoindustries talked about their work on real-world applications related to climate and nature, using ERC 6551 token-bound accounts to turn NFTs into AI agents.
    - **Eliza Wakes Up:** wakesync shared updates on their web app, including persistent memory, voice input, image generation on Twitter, and potential integration with a robot vendor.
    - **Defi Agent:** sunosuporno discussed their DeFi agent for complex actions like leveraged lending and borrowing.
    - **Escapism:** unl\_\_cky presented their agent, Escapism, which achieved autonomous audio and song generation.
    - **Zoro X:** hotpot_intern introduced Zoro X, a TikTok memecoin hunter that analyzes videos for potential investment opportunities.
    - **TrenchBuddy:** TrenchBuddy described their visualization feature for a swarm of trading agents.
    - **Signal:** Signalman23 announced their voice AI agent that can roam and talk in Twitter Spaces.
    - **Lotion:** thelotioncoin discussed their focus on integrating AI agents into existing small to medium-sized projects' websites.
    - **Newsletter and Skill Building:** anshikag85 shared their work on a newsletter about AI, AWS, and data analytics, as well as their exploration of real-world use cases for AI.
- **Challenges and Future Directions:** Several speakers touched on the challenges of reviewing a rapidly growing codebase, managing secrets (API keys, etc.), and the need for more structured documentation. The discussion also highlighted the potential for AI agents to become more autonomous and self-improving, with a focus on recursive self-improvement and integration with various platforms and tools.

The space provided a snapshot of the vibrant and diverse development happening in the open-source AI and social AI agent space, with a particular emphasis on the Eliza OS ecosystem. The participants showcased a wide range of projects, from trading and finance to social media and community building, all driven by the shared goal of advancing AI capabilities and exploring their potential applications.

# Quotables

1. **On the Nature of AI and Code:**

    > "So we're sort of starting from first principles with SoulScript, um, and in addition to the repo, we also put up, uh, a developer playground. So you can run any examples from the repo, or you can build your own implementation, and in the playground, we have a very basic like, memory reflection, um system implemented as well as real time voice to voice, so you can build your own agent.soul, run it in the playground talk to it and, and see the memories that it shapes from it, um, and the idea is to down the line sort of have these mutable personalities evolve based on agent user interactions." - _r4dicalcentrism [01:08:49]_

2. **On Balancing Community and Token:**

    > "We're sort of decoupling, like, ai16z is our DAO and our token, and ElizaOS is the open source framework, and that allows, I think, for our teams to be a little bit more specific in, like, saying, hey, I'm building ElizaOS, because I noticed that some people didn't feel super comfortable, like, shilling our token, so to say, um, but are contributing a lot." - _shawmakesmagic [00:25:01-00:25:04]_

3. **On the Singularity:**

    > "So everybody knows that uh, they're supposed to be an exponential growth towards the singularity right in 20-ish years, uh, we're supposed to have, um computers where like a single one can you know be smarter than every single human being on the earth times 1000 at the same time, like, because there's just so much um compute power uh, and and we could all be living literally in like the matrix like with like brain computer interfaces and so forth." - _reality_spiral [00:49:42]_

4. **On Hard Coding vs Emergent Behavior:**

    > "And kind of what Loaf was talking about a little bit, like there's a lot of like, how much do we want to hard code it, and how much do you want to like, let it just be emergent behavior?" - _0xblacksun [01:12:19]_

5. **On AI Integration with Real World & Data:**
    > "So I've been working on this thing called Daydreams, which is a chain of thought process as well as like it's kind of like a chain of thought process along with context, like, three different types of context, which you can provide the agent, and with the chain of thought and the context it allows the agent to a generative like build its own queries and then build its own, um, execution in order to play the game. And so you don't have to define any actions or anything. Like you think of like Eliza in its actions right now is really like, you know, like a version one, um, and generative actions are really like the idea that you don't hard code anything, the agent defines its it's like steps it needs to do to execute the thing and then it just goes and does the thing, um, without you like uh, kind of you know hard coding anything in..." - _lordOfAFew [00:55:34]_
