## Summary

In the Discord chat, Penguin sought assistance with registering actions for an EVM plugin, leading Ferric to share a potentially outdated but relevant doc link that helped Penguin proceed further. The discussion then shifted towards Eliza's minimum hardware requirements, where Odilitime and James Young provided insights on RAM needs due to playwright usage, with suggestions of using cloud providers for flexibility. Collaboration was proposed by James Young regarding a LangGraph plugin project. Ferric highlighted an engaging thread about enhancing bot personalities, while Odilitime mentioned contributor role assignments in GitHub PRs as a community milestone.

## FAQ

- How do I register actions and hook them up in an EVM plugin?
- Ferric: Provided a link to outdated documentation on plugins that might help with understanding the process of adding a plugin (https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/packages/plugins/). Odilitime mentioned Eliza's RAM requirements and offered assistance if needed.

- What is the minimum Mac specification required for running Eliza?
    - Ferric: Mentioned that any Mac would do, as you can use a cloud provider; however, Odilitime specified that Eliza requires about 16GB of RAM due to playwright usage and will idle under 2G.
