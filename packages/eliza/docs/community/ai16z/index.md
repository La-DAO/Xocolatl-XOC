## Eliza Agent Index

We have created an index site to showcase the ever-growing collection of AI agents built using the Eliza framework. Visit [Eliza Agent Index](https://elizas.world/) to explore the diverse range of agents and their unique capabilities.

## Community-Created Agents

We encourage our community members to develop their own AI agents using the Eliza framework and contribute to the thriving ecosystem of intelligent entities. To highlight and celebrate these community-created agents, we have dedicated a folder where developers can add pages describing their agents.

### Adding Your Agent

> WIP!!

To add a page for your AI agent, follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown file in the `community/ai-agents` directory with a descriptive name for your agent, e.g., `my-agent.md`.

2. Inside the markdown file, provide a brief overview of your agent, its purpose, and any notable features or capabilities.

3. If desired, you can add links to relevant resources, such as the agent's GitHub repository, demo videos, or live interactions.

4. Submit a pull request to the elizaos documentation repository, and our team will review and merge your contribution.
