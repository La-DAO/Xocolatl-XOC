# 🧩 Plugins

## Overview

Eliza's plugin system provides a modular way to extend the core functionality with additional features, actions, evaluators, and providers. Plugins are self-contained modules that can be easily added or removed to customize your agent's capabilities.

## Core Plugin Concepts

### Plugin Structure

Each plugin in Eliza must implement the `Plugin` interface with the following properties:

```typescript
interface Plugin {
    name: string; // Unique identifier for the plugin
    description: string; // Brief description of plugin functionality
    actions?: Action[]; // Custom actions provided by the plugin
    evaluators?: Evaluator[]; // Custom evaluators for behavior assessment
    providers?: Provider[]; // Context providers for message generation
    services?: Service[]; // Additional services (optional)
}
```

## Using Plugins

### Installation

1. Install the desired plugin package:

```bash
pnpm add @elizaos/plugin-[name]
```

2. Import and register the plugin in your character configuration:

```typescript
import { bootstrapPlugin } from "@eliza/plugin-bootstrap";
import { imageGenerationPlugin } from "@eliza/plugin-image-generation";
import { buttplugPlugin } from "@eliza/plugin-buttplug";
const character = {
    // ... other character config
    plugins: [bootstrapPlugin, imageGenerationPlugin, buttplugPlugin],
};
```

---

##### Coinbase Wallet Management

The plugin automatically handles wallet creation or uses an existing wallet if the required details are provided during the first run.

1. **Wallet Generation on First Run**
   If no wallet information is provided (`COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED` and `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID`), the plugin will:

    - **Generate a new wallet** using the Coinbase SDK.
    - Automatically **export the wallet details** (`seed` and `walletId`) and securely store them in `runtime.character.settings.secrets` or other configured storage.
    - Log the wallet’s default address for reference.
    - If the character file does not exist, the wallet details are saved to a characters/charactername-seed.txt file in the characters directory with a note indicating that the user must manually add these details to settings.secrets or the .env file.

2. **Using an Existing Wallet**
   If wallet information is available during the first run:
    - Provide `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED` and `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID` via `runtime.character.settings.secrets` or environment variables.
    - The plugin will **import the wallet** and use it for processing mass payouts.

---

#### 6. Coinbase MassPayments Plugin (`@eliza/plugin-coinbase`)

This plugin facilitates the processing of cryptocurrency mass payouts using the Coinbase SDK. It enables the creation and management of mass payouts to multiple wallet addresses, logging all transaction details to a CSV file for further analysis.

**Actions:**

- `SEND_MASS_PAYOUT`
  Sends cryptocurrency mass payouts to multiple wallet addresses.
    - **Inputs**:
        - `receivingAddresses` (array of strings): Wallet addresses to receive funds.
        - `transferAmount` (number): Amount to send to each address (in smallest currency unit, e.g., Wei for ETH).
        - `assetId` (string): Cryptocurrency asset ID (e.g., `ETH`, `BTC`).
        - `network` (string): Blockchain network (e.g., `base`, `sol`, `eth`, `arb`, `pol`).

        {
            "receivingAddresses": [
                "0xA0ba2ACB5846A54834173fB0DD9444F756810f06",
                "0xF14F2c49aa90BaFA223EE074C1C33b59891826bF"
            ],
            "transferAmount": 5000000000000000,
            "assetId": "ETH",
            "network": "eth"
        }
        ```

**Providers:**

- `massPayoutProvider`
  Retrieves details of past transactions from the generated CSV file.
    - **Outputs**: A list of transaction records including the following fields:
        - `address`: Recipient wallet address.
        - `amount`: Amount sent.
        - `status`: Transaction status (`Success` or `Failed`).
        - `errorCode`: Error code (if any).
        - `transactionUrl`: URL for transaction details (if available).

**Description:**

The Coinbase MassPayments plugin streamlines cryptocurrency distribution, ensuring efficient and scalable payouts to multiple recipients on supported blockchain networks.

Supported networks:

- `base` (Base blockchain)
- `sol` (Solana)
- `eth` (Ethereum)
- `arb` (Arbitrum)
- `pol` (Polygon)

**Setup and Configuration:**

1. **Configure the Plugin**
   Add the plugin to your character's configuration:

    ```typescript
    import { coinbaseMassPaymentsPlugin } from "@eliza/plugin-coinbase-masspayments";

    const character = {
        plugins: [coinbaseMassPaymentsPlugin],
    };
    ```

2. **Required Configurations**
   Set the following environment variables or runtime settings:

    - `COINBASE_API_KEY`: API key for Coinbase SDK
    - `COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for secure transactions
    - `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED`: Hexadecimal seed of the wallet (if using existing wallet)
    - `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID`: Unique wallet ID (if using existing wallet)

**Wallet Management:**

The plugin handles wallet creation and management in two ways:

1. **Automatic Wallet Creation**
   When no wallet details are provided, the plugin will:

    - Generate a new wallet using the Coinbase SDK
    - Export and store the wallet details in `runtime.character.settings.secrets`
    - Save details to `characters/charactername-seed.txt` if character file doesn't exist
    - Log the wallet's default address

2. **Using Existing Wallet**
   When wallet information is available:
    - Provide the required wallet details via settings or environment variables
    - The plugin will import and use the existing wallet

**Example Configuration:**

```typescript
// For automatic wallet generation
runtime.character.settings.secrets = {
    // Empty settings for first run
};

// For using existing wallet
runtime.character.settings.secrets = {
    COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED:
        "0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
    COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID: "wallet-id-123",
};
```

**Example Call**

```typescript
const response = await runtime.processAction("SEND_MASS_PAYOUT", {
    receivingAddresses: [
        "0xA0ba2ACB5846A54834173fB0DD9444F756810f06",
        "0xF14F2c49aa90BaFA223EE074C1C33b59891826bF",
    ],
    transferAmount: 5000000000000000, // 0.005 ETH
    assetId: "ETH",
    network: "eth",
});
console.log("Mass payout response:", response);
```

**Transaction Logging**

All transactions (successful and failed) are logged to a `transactions.csv` file in the plugin’s working directory:

```plaintext
Address,Amount,Status,Error Code,Transaction URL
0xA0ba2ACB5846A54834173fB0DD9444F756810f06,5000000000000000,Success,,https://etherscan.io/tx/0x...
```

**Example Output:**

When successful, a response similar to the following will be returned:

```json
{
    "text": "Mass payouts completed successfully.\n- Successful Transactions: 2\n- Failed Transactions: 0\nCheck the CSV file for more details."
}
```

**Best Practices:**

- **Secure Secrets Storage**: Ensure `COINBASE_API_KEY` and `COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` are stored securely in `runtime.character.settings.secrets` or environment variables. Either add `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_HEX_SEED`, and `COINBASE_GENERATED_WALLET_ID` from a previous run, or it will be dynamically created
- **Validation**: Always validate input parameters, especially `receivingAddresses` and `network`, to ensure compliance with expected formats and supported networks.
- **Error Handling**: Monitor logs for failed transactions or errors in the payout process and adjust retry logic as needed.

        "subject-identifier",
    );
    // rawKey is a DeriveKeyResponse that can be used for further processing
    // to get the uint8Array do the following
    const rawKeyArray = rawKey.asUint8Array();
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Raw key derivation failed:", error);
}

// Derive a Solana keypair (Ed25519)
try {
    const solanaKeypair = await provider.deriveEd25519Keypair(
        "/path/to/derive",
        "subject-identifier",
    );
    // solanaKeypair can now be used for Solana operations
} catch (error) {

**Mock attestation server:**

For local development and testing, you can use a [mock attestation server](https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo/tree/master/attestation/server-custom-mock) that generates attestations based on a local root of trust. See the linked README for more detailed information.

**From source:**

Requires Rust to be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/marlinprotocol/oyster-monorepo
cd oyster-monorepo/attestation/server-custom-mock

# Listens on 127.0.0.1:1350 by default
cargo run

# To customize listening interface and port
cargo run --ip-addr <ip>:<port>
```

**Using Docker:**

```
# The server runs on 1350 inside Docker, can remap to any interface and port
docker run --init -p 127.0.0.1:1350:1350 marlinorg/attestation-server-custom-mock
```

### 12. Allora Plugin (`@elizaos/allora-plugin`)

The [Allora Network](https://allora.network) plugin seamlessly empowers Eliza agents with real-time, advanced, self-improving AI inferences, delivering high-performance insights without introducing any additional complexity.

#### Setup and Configuration

1. Add the plugin to your character's configuration

    ```typescript
    import { alloraPlugin } from "@eliza/plugin-allora";

    const character = {
        plugins: [alloraPlugin],
    };
    ```

2. Set the following environment variables:
    - `ALLORA_API_KEY`: Create an API key by [creating an account](https://developer.upshot.xyz/signup).

#### Actions

- `GET_INFERENCE`: Retrieves predictions for a specific topic.

Example interactions:

```
User: "What is the predicted ETH price in 5 minutes?"
Agent: "I'll get the inference now..."
Agent: "Inference provided by Allora Network on topic ETH 5min Prediction (ID: 13): 3393.364326646801085508"
```

For detailed information and additional implementation examples, please refer to the [Allora-Eliza integration docs](https://docs.allora.network/marketplace/integrations/eliza-os).

### Writing Custom Plugins

Create a new plugin by implementing the Plugin interface:

```typescript
import { Plugin, Action, Evaluator, Provider } from "@elizaos/core";

const myCustomPlugin: Plugin = {
    name: "my-custom-plugin",
    description: "Adds custom functionality",
    actions: [
        /* custom actions */
    ],
    evaluators: [
        /* custom evaluators */
    ],
    providers: [
        /* custom providers */
    ],
    services: [
        /* custom services */
    ],
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: Keep plugins focused on specific functionality
2. **Dependencies**: Clearly document any external dependencies
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling
4. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation for actions and evaluators
5. **Testing**: Include tests for plugin functionality

## Plugin Development Guidelines

### Action Development

- Implement the `Action` interface
- Provide clear validation logic
- Include usage examples
- Handle errors gracefully

### Evaluator Development

- Implement the `Evaluator` interface
- Define clear evaluation criteria
- Include validation logic
- Document evaluation metrics

### Provider Development

- Implement the `Provider` interface
- Define context generation logic
- Handle state management
- Document provider capabilities

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Plugin Loading Issues

```typescript
// Check if plugins are loaded correctly
if (character.plugins) {
    console.log("Plugins are: ", character.plugins);
    const importedPlugins = await Promise.all(
        character.plugins.map(async (plugin) => {
            const importedPlugin = await import(plugin);
            return importedPlugin;
        }),
    );
    character.plugins = importedPlugins;
}
```

### Service Registration

```typescript
// Proper service registration
registerService(service: Service): void {
    const serviceType = (service as typeof Service).serviceType;
    if (this.services.has(serviceType)) {
        console.warn(`Service ${serviceType} is already registered`);
        return;
    }
    this.services.set(serviceType, service);
}
```

## Future Extensions

The plugin system is designed to be extensible. Future additions may include:

- Database adapters
- Authentication providers
- Custom model providers
- External API integrations
- Workflow automation
- Custom UI components

## Contributing

To contribute a new plugin:

1. Follow the plugin structure guidelines
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Add tests for all functionality
4. Submit a pull request
5. Update the plugin registry

For detailed API documentation and examples, see the [API Reference](/api).
