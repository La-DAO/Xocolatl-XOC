# 🪪 Verified Inference

## Overview

With verified inference, you can turn your Eliza agent fully verifiable on-chain on Solana with an OpenAI compatible TEE API. This proves that your agent’s thoughts and outputs are free from human control thus increasing the trust of the agent. 

Compared to [fully deploying the agent in a TEE](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/advanced/eliza-in-tee/), this is a more light-weight solution which only verifies the inference calls and only needs a single line of code change. 

The API supports all OpenAI models out of the box, including your fine-tuned models. The following guide will walk you through how to use verified inference API with Eliza. 

## Background

The API is built on top of [Sentience Stack](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/Sentience), which cryptographically verifies agent's LLM inferences inside TEEs, posts those proofs on-chain on Solana, and makes the verified inference logs available to read and display to users.

Here’s how it works:

1. The agent sends a request containing a message with the desired LLM model to the TEE.  
2. The TEE securely processes the request by calling the LLM API.  
3. The TEE sends back the `{Message, Proof}` to the agent.  
4. The TEE submits the attestation with `{Message, Proof}` to Solana.  
5. The Proof of Sentience SDK is used to read the attestation from Solana and verify it with `{Message, Proof}`. The proof log can be added to the agent website/app.

To verify the code running inside the TEE, use instructions [from here](https://github.com/galadriel-ai/sentience/tree/main/verified-inference/verify).

## Tutorial

1. **Create a free API key on [Galadriel dashboard](https://dashboard.galadriel.com/login)**
2. **Configure the environment variables**
    ```bash
    GALADRIEL_API_KEY=gal-*         # Get from https://dashboard.galadriel.com/
    # Use any model supported by OpenAI
    SMALL_GALADRIEL_MODEL=          # Default: gpt-4o-mini
    MEDIUM_GALADRIEL_MODEL=         # Default: gpt-4o
    LARGE_GALADRIEL_MODEL=          # Default: gpt-4o
    # If you wish to use a fine-tuned model you will need to provide your own OpenAI API key
    GALADRIEL_FINE_TUNE_API_KEY=    # starting with sk-
    ```
3. **Configure your character to use `galadriel`**

    In your character file set the `modelProvider` as `galadriel`.
    ```
    "modelProvider": "galadriel"
    ```
4. **Run your agent.**

    Reminder how to run an agent is [here](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart/#create-your-first-agent).
    ```bash
    pnpm start --character="characters/<your_character>.json"
    pnpm start:client
    ```
5. **Get the history of all of your verified inference calls**
    ```javascript
    const url = 'https://api.galadriel.com/v1/verified/chat/completions?limit=100&filter=mine';
    const headers = {
    'accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <GALADRIEL_API_KEY>'// Replace with your Galadriel API key
    };
    
    const response = await fetch(url, { method: 'GET', headers });
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
    ```
    
    Use this to build a verified logs terminal to your agent front end, for example:

6. **Check your inferences in the explorer.**

    You can also see your inferences with proofs in the [Galadriel explorer](https://explorer.galadriel.com/).  For specific inference responses use `https://explorer.galadriel.com/details/<hash>` 
    
    The `hash` param is returned with every inference request.

7. **Check proofs posted on Solana.**

    You can also see your inferences with proofs on Solana. For specific inference responses: `https://explorer.solana.com/tx/<>tx_hash?cluster=devnet` 

    The `tx_hash` param is returned with every inference request.
