# Frequently Asked Questions

## Eliza FAQ

### What is Eliza?

**Eliza is an open-source, multi-agent simulation framework for creating and managing autonomous AI agents.** The project aims to empower developers and users to build unique AI personalities that can interact across various platforms, such as Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.

### Who is behind Eliza?

The Eliza project is led by [Shaw](https://x.com/shawmakesmagic). The project is open source, and its code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza

### How can I get started with Eliza?

To begin building your own AI agents with Eliza, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Python, Node.js and pnpm**: Ensure you have the necessary software prerequisites installed on your system. We use node v23.
2.  **Set up your environment**: Create a `.env` file and populate it with the required API keys, database configuration, and platform-specific tokens.
3.  **Install Eliza**: Use the command `npm install @elizaos/core` or `pnpm add @elizaos/core` to install the Eliza package.
4.  **Configure your database**: Eliza currently relies on Supabase for local development. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up your Supabase project and database.
5.  **Define your agent's character**: Create a character file using the provided JSON format to specify your agent's personality, knowledge, and behavior.
6.  **Run Eliza locally**: Use the provided commands to start the Eliza framework and interact with your agent.

### What are the key components of Eliza?

Eliza's architecture consists of several interconnected components:

- **Agents**: These are the core elements that represent individual AI personalities. Agents operate within a runtime environment and interact with various platforms.
- **Actions**: Actions are predefined behaviors that agents can execute in response to messages, enabling them to perform tasks and interact with external systems.
- **Clients**: Clients act as interfaces between agents and specific platforms, such as Discord, Twitter, and Telegram. They handle platform-specific message formats and communication protocols.
- **Plugins**: Plugins are modular way to extend the core functionality with additional features, actions, evaluators, and providers. They are self-contained modules that can be easily added or removed to customize your agent's capabilities
- **Providers**: Providers supply agents with contextual information, including time awareness, user relationships, and data from external sources.
- **Evaluators**: These modules assess and extract information from conversations, helping agents track goals, build memory, and maintain context awareness.
- **Character Files**: These JSON files define the personality, knowledge, and behavior of each AI agent.
- **Memory System**: Eliza features a sophisticated memory management system that utilizes vector embeddings and relational database storage to store and retrieve information for agents.

### How can I contribute to the Eliza project?

Eliza welcomes contributions from individuals with a wide range of skills:
