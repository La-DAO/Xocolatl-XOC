_As seen powering [@DegenSpartanAI](https://x.com/degenspartanai) and [@MarcAIndreessen](https://x.com/pmairca)_

- Multi-agent simulation framework
- Add as many unique characters as you want with [characterfile](https://github.com/lalalune/characterfile/)
- Full-featured Discord and Twitter connectors, with Discord voice channel support
- Full conversational and document RAG memory
- Can read links and PDFs, transcribe audio and videos, summarize conversations, and more
- Highly extensible - create your own actions and clients to extend Eliza's capabilities
- Supports open source and local models (default configured with Nous Hermes Llama 3.1B)
- Supports OpenAI for cloud inference on a light-weight device
- "Ask Claude" mode for calling Claude on more complex queries
- 100% Typescript

# Getting Started

**Prerequisites (MUST):**

- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Edit the .env file

- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values
- Edit the TWITTER environment variables to add your bot's username and password

### Edit the character file

- Check out the file `src/core/defaultCharacter.ts` - you can modify this
- You can also load characters with the `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"` and run multiple bots at the same time.

After setting up the .env file and character file, you can start the bot with the following command:

```
pnpm i
pnpm start
```

# Customising Eliza

### Adding custom actions

To avoid git clashes in the core directory, we recommend adding custom actions to a `custom_actions` directory and then adding them to the `elizaConfig.yaml` file. See the `elizaConfig.example.yaml` file for an example.

## Running with different models

### Run with Llama

You can run Llama 70B or 405B models by setting the environment variable for a provider that supports these models. Llama is also supported locally if no other provider is set.

### Run with Grok

You can run Grok models by setting the `GROK_API_KEY` environment variable to your Grok API key and setting grok as the model provider in your character file.

### Run with OpenAI

You can run OpenAI models by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key and setting openai as the model provider in your character file.

## Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```

# Environment Setup

You will need to add environment variables to your .env file to connect to various platforms:

```
# Required environment variables
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=
DISCORD_API_TOKEN= # Bot token
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-* # OpenAI API key, starting with sk-
ELEVENLABS_XI_API_KEY= # API key from elevenlabs

# ELEVENLABS SETTINGS

# Local Inference Setup

### CUDA Setup

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can install CUDA to speed up local inference dramatically.

```
pnpm install
npx --no node-llama-cpp source download --gpu cuda
```

Make sure that you've installed the CUDA Toolkit, including cuDNN and cuBLAS.

### Running locally

By default, the bot will download and use a local model. You can change this by setting the environment variables for the model you want to use.

# Clients

## Discord Bot

For help with setting up your Discord Bot, check out here: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html

# Development

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
pnpm test           # Run tests once
pnpm test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
```

For database-specific tests:

```bash
pnpm test:sqlite   # Run tests with SQLite
pnpm test:sqljs    # Run tests with SQL.js
```

Tests are written using Jest and can be found in `src/**/*.test.ts` files. The test environment is configured to:

- Load environment variables from `.env.test`
- Use a 2-minute timeout for long-running tests
- Support ESM modules
- Run tests in sequence (--runInBand)

To create new tests, add a `.test.ts` file adjacent to the code you're testing.

## Docs Updates

Please make sure to verify if the documentation provided is correct. In order to do so, please run the docs service.

```console
docker compose -f docker-compose-docs.yaml up --build
```

The docusaurus server will get started and you can verify it locally at https://localhost:3000/eliza.
