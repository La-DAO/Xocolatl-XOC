## API Reference

### Core Components

1. **FereProService**

    - Manages WebSocket connections
    - Handles message sending/receiving
    - Processes streaming responses
    - Tracks credits and usage

2. **Actions**
    - SEND_FEREPRO_MESSAGE: Primary action for API communication
    - Supports market queries and analysis requests
    - Handles both streaming and non-streaming responses

### Response Structure

```typescript
interface ChatResponse {
    answer: string;
    chat_id: string;
    representation?: Record<string, any>[];
    agent_api_name: string;
    query_summary: string;
    agent_credits: number;
    credits_available: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling for:

- WebSocket connection issues
- Invalid message formats
- API response errors
- Credit limitation issues

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failures**

    - Verify your internet connection
    - Check if the FerePro API service is available
    - Ensure your FERE_USER_ID is valid and active

2. **Message Timeout**

    - The connection might time out for long-running queries
    - Consider using streaming mode for large data requests
    - Implement retry logic for important queries

3. **Credit Depletion**
    - Monitor credits_available in responses
    - Set up alerts for low credit situations
    - Contact FerePro support for credit top-up

### Response Parsing

1. **Invalid Response Format**

    - Check if the query is properly formatted
    - Verify the message structure matches the API requirements
    - Enable debug mode for detailed error information

2. **Missing Data**
    - Ensure the requested timeframe is valid
    - Verify the cryptocurrencies exist in the database
    - Check if you have access to the requested data tier

## Safety & Best Practices

### Security

1. **API Credentials**

    - Never expose your FERE_USER_ID in public repositories
    - Use environment variables for sensitive data
    - Rotate credentials periodically if possible

2. **Rate Limiting**
    - Implement appropriate delays between requests
    - Monitor credit usage to prevent unexpected depletion
    - Cache responses when appropriate

### Data Handling

1. **Response Validation**

    - Always validate response data before processing
    - Implement proper error handling for malformed data
    - Log unexpected response formats for debugging

2. **Stream Management**
    - Close WebSocket connections properly after use
    - Implement reconnection logic for dropped connections
    - Handle partial responses in streaming mode

### Best Practices

1. **Query Optimization**

    - Keep queries focused and specific
    - Use streaming for large data requests
    - Implement caching for frequently requested data

2. **Error Handling**

    - Implement comprehensive error catching
    - Log errors with appropriate context
    - Provide meaningful error messages to users

3. **Resource Management**
    - Monitor WebSocket connection status
    - Implement connection pooling for high-volume usage
    - Clean up resources properly on service shutdown
