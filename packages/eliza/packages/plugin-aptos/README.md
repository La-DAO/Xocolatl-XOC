# @elizaos/plugin-aptos

A plugin for interacting with the Aptos blockchain network within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Description

The Aptos plugin enables seamless token transfers and wallet management on the Aptos blockchain. It provides functionality to transfer APT tokens and monitor wallet balances with real-time price tracking.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-aptos
```

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables to be set:

```typescript
APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Aptos private key>
APTOS_NETWORK=<"mainnet" | "testnet">
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import {
    aptosPlugin,
    WalletProvider,
    TransferAptosToken,
} from "@elizaos/plugin-aptos";
```

### Transfer Examples

```typescript
// The plugin responds to natural language commands like:

"Send 69 APT tokens to 0x4f2e63be8e7fe287836e29cde6f3d5cbc96eefd0c0e3f3747668faa2ae7324b0";
"Transfer APT to [address]";
"Pay [amount] APT to [recipient]";
```

## API Reference

#### SEND_TOKEN

Transfers APT tokens from the agent's wallet to another address.

**Aliases:**

- TRANSFER_TOKEN
- TRANSFER_TOKENS

**Features:**

- Real-time APT price tracking
- Portfolio value calculation
- Cached wallet information (5-minute TTL)
- Formatted portfolio reports

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

1. **Transaction Failures**

    - Verify wallet has sufficient APT balance
    - Check recipient address format
    - Ensure private key is correctly set
    - Verify network connectivity

2. **Price Fetching Issues**
    - Check connection to DexScreener API
    - Verify cache functionality
    - Monitor retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Private Key Management**
    - Store private key securely using environment variables
    - Never commit private keys to version control
    - Use separate wallets for development and production
    - Monitor wallet activity regularly
