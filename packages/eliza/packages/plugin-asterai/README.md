# @elizaos/plugin-asterai

A plugin for interacting with [asterai](https://asterai.io) plugins and agents.

## Description

This plugin provides functionality to allow Eliza agents to interact with
asterai plugins and agents.

This will expand your Eliza character's utility by giving it access to all
the functionality of asterai's ecosystem of marketplace and private plugins
and agents.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-asterai
```

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables to be set:

```typescript
ASTERAI_AGENT_ID=
ASTERAI_PUBLIC_QUERY_KEY=
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { asteraiPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-asterai';
```

### Example Usage

The plugin supports natural language for interacting with the asterai agent
through your Eliza character.

For example, if your asterai agent can fetch weather data:

```typescript
"Hey Eliza, how's the weather in LA?"
```

Eliza will then query the asterai agent to fetch the information.
