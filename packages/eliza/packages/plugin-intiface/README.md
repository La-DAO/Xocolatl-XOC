# @elizaos/plugin-intiface

Intiface/Buttplug.io integration plugin for Eliza OS that enables control of intimate hardware devices.

## Features

- Support for multiple intimate hardware devices through Buttplug.io protocol
- Automatic device discovery and connection management
- Battery level monitoring for supported devices
- Vibration and rotation control (device-dependent)
- Graceful connection handling and cleanup
- Built-in device simulation for testing
- Support for customizable vibration patterns
- Automatic Intiface Engine management

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-intiface
```

## Configuration

The plugin can be configured through environment variables or runtime settings:

```env
INTIFACE_URL=ws://localhost:12345
INTIFACE_NAME=Eliza Intiface Client
DEVICE_NAME=Lovense Nora
```

## Usage

### Basic Device Control

```typescript
import { intifacePlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-intiface";

// Vibrate device
const result = await eliza.execute({
    action: "VIBRATE",
    content: {
        strength: 0.5, // 0.0 to 1.0
        duration: 1000, // milliseconds
    },
});

// Check battery level
const battery = await eliza.execute({
    action: "BATTERY",
    content: {},
});
```

### Advanced Features

```typescript
// Rotation control (for supported devices)
const result = await eliza.execute({
    action: "ROTATE",
    content: {
        strength: 0.7,
        duration: 2000,
    },
});
```

## Device Support

The plugin supports various devices through the Buttplug protocol, including but not limited to:

- Lovense devices (Nora, Max, etc.)
- WeVibe products
- Kiiroo devices
- Magic Motion products
- And many others supported by Buttplug.io

## Testing

The plugin includes a simulation mode for testing without physical hardware:

```bash
pnpm test-via-bun
```

## Dependencies

- Buttplug.io (v3.2.2)
- Intiface Engine
- WebSocket support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Problems**

    - Verify Intiface Engine is running (`ws://localhost:12345` by default)
    - Check device Bluetooth is enabled and in pairing mode
    - Ensure device is charged and within range
    - Try restarting both device and Intiface Engine

2. **Device Not Found**

    - Confirm device is supported by Buttplug.io
    - Try manual device pairing through Intiface Central first
    - Check if device requires specific firmware version
    - Verify device is not connected to another application

3. **Command Failures**

    - Check battery level is sufficient
    - Ensure device is within supported range for command values
    - Verify device supports the specific command (vibrate/rotate)
    - Monitor Intiface Engine logs for detailed error messages

4. **Performance Issues**
    - Reduce command frequency if experiencing lag
    - Check for Bluetooth interference
    - Monitor system resources for potential bottlenecks
    - Consider using wired connection if available

## Security Best Practices

1. **Device Privacy**

    - Use secure WebSocket connections (wss://) when possible
    - Don't expose Intiface Engine to public networks
    - Regularly check for and apply firmware updates
    - Monitor device connection status

2. **Data Protection**

    - Clear device pairing history when needed
    - Don't store sensitive device information
    - Use unique device names for identification
    - Implement timeouts for idle connections

3. **Access Control**

    - Limit device control to authenticated users
    - Implement command rate limiting
    - Use device-specific permissions where applicable
    - Monitor and log unusual command patterns

4. **Network Security**
    - Keep Intiface Engine behind firewall
    - Use local connections when possible
    - Implement connection timeouts
    - Regular security audits of configurations
