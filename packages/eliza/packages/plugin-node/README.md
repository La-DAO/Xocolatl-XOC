elizaos.registerPlugin(nodePlugin);
```

## Services

### AwsS3Service

Handles file uploads and management with AWS S3.

### BrowserService

Provides web scraping and content extraction capabilities using Playwright.

### ImageDescriptionService

Processes and analyzes images to generate descriptions. Supports multiple providers:

- Local processing using Florence model
- OpenAI Vision API
- Google Gemini

Configuration:

```env
# For OpenAI Vision
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# For Google Gemini
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

Provider selection:

- If `imageVisionModelProvider` is set to `google/openai`, it will use this one.
- Else if `model` is set to `google/openai`, it will use this one.
- Default if nothing is set is OpenAI.

The service automatically handles different image formats, including GIFs (first frame extraction).

Features by provider:

**Local (Florence):**

- Basic image captioning
- Local processing without API calls

**OpenAI Vision:**

- Detailed image descriptions
- Text detection
- Object recognition

**Google Gemini 1.5:**

- High-quality image understanding
- Detailed descriptions with natural language
- Multi-modal context understanding
- Support for complex scenes and content

The provider can be configured through the runtime settings, allowing easy switching between providers based on your needs.

### LlamaService

Provides local LLM capabilities using LLaMA models.

### PdfService

Extracts and processes text content from PDF files.

### SpeechService

Handles text-to-speech conversion using ElevenLabs and VITS.

### TranscriptionService

Converts speech to text using various providers.

### VideoService

Processes video content, including YouTube video downloads and transcription.

## Actions

### describeImage

Analyzes and generates descriptions for images.

```typescript
// Example usage
const result = await runtime.executeAction("DESCRIBE_IMAGE", {
    imageUrl: "path/to/image.jpg",
});
```

## Dependencies

The plugin requires several peer dependencies:

- `onnxruntime-node`: 1.20.1
- `whatwg-url`: 7.1.0

And trusted dependencies:

- `onnxruntime-node`: 1.20.1
- `sharp`: 0.33.5

## Safety & Security

### File Operations

- **Path Sanitization**: All file paths are sanitized to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **File Size Limits**: Enforced limits on upload sizes
- **Type Checking**: Strict file type validation
- **Temporary File Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### API Keys & Credentials

- **Environment Isolation**: Sensitive credentials are isolated in environment variables
- **Access Scoping**: Services are initialized with minimum required permissions
- **Key Rotation**: Support for credential rotation without service interruption

### Media Processing

- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU usage limits for media processing
- **Timeout Controls**: Automatic termination of long-running processes
- **Format Validation**: Strict media format validation before processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Initialization Failures**

```bash
Error: Service initialization failed
```

- Verify environment variables are properly set
- Check service dependencies are installed
- Ensure sufficient system permissions

2. **Media Processing Errors**

```bash
Error: Failed to process media file
```

- Verify file format is supported
- Check available system memory
- Ensure ffmpeg is properly installed

3. **AWS S3 Connection Issues**
