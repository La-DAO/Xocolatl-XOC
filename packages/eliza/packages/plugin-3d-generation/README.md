# @elizaos/plugin-3d-generation

A plugin for generating 3D models using the FAL.ai API within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Description

The 3D Generation plugin enables AI-powered creation of 3D models through FAL.ai's services. It provides functionality to generate 3D models from text descriptions and save them locally.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-3d-generation
```

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variable or runtime setting to be set:

```typescript
FAL_API_KEY=<Your FAL.ai API key>
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { ThreeDGenerationPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-3d-generation";
```

### Model Generation Examples

```typescript
// The plugin responds to natural language commands like:

"Generate a 3D object of a cat playing piano";
"Create a 3D object of an anime character Goku";
"Make a 3D model of [your description]";
```

## API Reference

### Actions

#### GENERATE_3D

Generates 3D models based on text descriptions.

**Aliases:**

- 3D_GENERATION
- 3D_GEN
- CREATE_3D
- MAKE_3D
- TEXT23D
- TEXT_TO_3D
- 3D_CREATE
- 3D_MAKE

**Default Configuration:**

```typescript
{
    geometry_file_format: "glb",  // Available: glb, usdz, fbx, obj, stl
    material: "PBR",             // Available: PBR, Shaded
    quality: "medium",           // Available: extra-low, low, medium, high
    tier: "Regular"              // Available: Regular, Sketch
}
```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

1. **Generation Failures**

    - Verify FAL API key is correctly set
    - Ensure prompt is descriptive (minimum 3 characters)
    - Check network connectivity to FAL.ai services

2. **Storage Issues**
    - Verify write permissions to content_cache directory
    - Ensure sufficient disk space
    - Check if content_cache directory exists

## Security Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**
    - Store FAL API key securely using runtime settings or environment variables
    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Monitor API usage
