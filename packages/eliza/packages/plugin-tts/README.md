A plugin for text-to-speech(TTS) generation using the FAL.ai API within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Description

The text-to-speech(TTS) plugin enables AI-powered creation of speech through FAL.ai's services. It provides functionality to generate audio from text descriptions, automatically detects language, and selects appropriate voice models.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-tts
```

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variable or runtime setting to be set:

// The plugin responds to natural language commands like:

"Generate TTS of Hello World";
"Create a TTS for Welcome to ElizaOS";
"Make a TTS saying [your text]";
```
