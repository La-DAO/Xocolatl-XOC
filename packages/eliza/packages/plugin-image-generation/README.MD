# Plugin Image Generation

A plugin designed for generating and managing images, providing features like image manipulation, storage integration, and optimized handling for various use cases.

## Overview

The Plugin Image Generation offers developers tools to handle image-related operations seamlessly. It supports image creation, manipulation, and integration with storage solutions, making it ideal for applications requiring dynamic image generation.

### Features

- Dynamic image generation
- Integration with storage solutions
- Optimized handling for high-resolution images

## Installation Instructions

To install the plugin, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm install plugin-image-generation
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set:

| Variable Name          | Description                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `IMAGE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Name of the storage bucket.         |
| `STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`   | Access key for storage integration. |
| `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`   | Secret key for storage integration. |

### TypeScript Configuration

The plugin assumes a TypeScript environment. Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes the necessary compiler options:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "ESNext",
        "target": "ES6",
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "strict": true
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Generate an Image

The main functionality allows generating an image dynamically.

```typescript
import { generateImage } from "plugin-image-generation";

const image = await generateImage({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
    text: "Hello World",
    font: "Arial",
});

console.log("Generated Image:", image);
```

### Upload to Storage

The plugin supports direct integration with storage solutions for uploading images.

```typescript
import { uploadImage } from "plugin-image-generation";

const uploadResult = await uploadImage({
    imagePath: "path/to/image.png",
    bucketName: "my-storage-bucket",
});

console.log("Image uploaded successfully:", uploadResult);
```

## API Reference

### generateImage

#### Parameters

- `width`: Width of the image.
- `height`: Height of the image.
- `backgroundColor`: Background color of the image.
- `text`: Text to be displayed on the image.
- `font`: Font style for the text.

#### Returns

A promise that resolves with the generated image.

### uploadImage

#### Parameters
