# @elizaos/plugin-fuel

A plugin for interacting with the Fuel blockchain within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Description

This plugin provides essential functionality for interacting with the Fuel blockchain, focusing on ETH transfers on the Fuel Ignition network. It offers a streamlined way to manage Fuel blockchain transactions through natural language commands.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-fuel
```

## Configuration

The plugin requires the following environment variables to be set:

```typescript
FUEL_PRIVATE_KEY=<Private key for the Fuel wallet starting with 0x>
FUEL_PROVIDER_URL=<Custom RPC endpoint URL (optional, defaults to "https://mainnet.fuel.network/v1/graphql")>
```

## Usage

### Basic Integration

```typescript
import { fuelPlugin } from "@elizaos/plugin-fuel";
```

### Example Usage

The plugin supports natural language commands for ETH transfers:

```typescript
"Transfer 1 ETH to 0x8F8afB12402C9a4bD9678Bec363E51360142f8443FB171655eEd55dB298828D1";
```

## API Reference

### Actions

#### TRANSFER

Transfers ETH between addresses on the Fuel Ignition network.

**Aliases:**

- TRANSFER_FUEL_ETH
- SEND_TOKENS

**Input Content:**

```typescript
interface TransferParams {
    toAddress: string; // Recipient's Fuel address
    amount: string; // Amount of ETH to transfer
}
```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**

    - Verify provider URL is accessible
    - Check network connectivity
    - Ensure proper network configuration

2. **Transaction Failures**

    - Verify sufficient balance for transfers
    - Check correct address format
    - Ensure gas fees can be covered

3. **Authentication Issues**
    - Validate private key format
    - Verify wallet configuration
    - Check network permissions

## Security Best Practices

1. **Key Management**

    - Store private keys securely
    - Use environment variables for sensitive data
    - Never expose private keys in code or logs

2. **Transaction Safety**
    - Validate recipient addresses
    - Implement proper error handling
    - Double-check transaction amounts
