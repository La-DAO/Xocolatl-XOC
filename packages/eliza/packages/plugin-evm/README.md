# @elizaos/plugin-evm

This plugin provides actions and providers for interacting with EVM-compatible chains.

## Description

The EVM plugin provides comprehensive functionality for interacting with EVM-compatible chains, including token transfers, cross-chain bridging, and token swaps using LiFi integration.

## Features

- Multi-chain support with dynamic chain configuration
- Native token transfers
- Cross-chain token bridging via LiFi
- Token swapping on supported DEXs
- Wallet balance tracking
- Custom RPC endpoint configuration
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive transaction management

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @elizaos/plugin-evm
```

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```env
# Required
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here

# Optional - Custom RPC URLs
EVM_PROVIDER_URL=https://your-custom-mainnet-rpc-url
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_<CHAIN_NAME>=https://your-custom-rpc-url
```

### Chain Configuration

By default, **Ethereum mainnet** is enabled. To enable additional chains, add them to your character config:

```json
"settings": {
    "chains": {
        "evm": [
            "base", "arbitrum", "iotex"
        ]
    }
}
```

Note: The chain names must match those in the viem/chains.

### Custom RPC URLs

By default, the RPC URL is inferred from the `viem/chains` config. To use a custom RPC URL for a specific chain, add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_<CHAIN_NAME>=https://your-custom-rpc-url
```

**Example usage:**

```env
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_IOTEX=https://iotex-network.rpc.thirdweb.com
```

#### Custom RPC for Ethereum Mainnet

To set a custom RPC URL for Ethereum mainnet, use:

```env
EVM_PROVIDER_URL=https://your-custom-mainnet-rpc-url
```

## Provider

The **Wallet Provider** initializes with the **first chain in the list** as the default (or Ethereum mainnet if none are added). It:

- Provides the **context** of the currently connected address and its balance.
- Creates **Public** and **Wallet clients** to interact with the supported chains.
- Allows adding chains dynamically at runtime.

## Actions

### 1. Transfer

Transfer native tokens on the same chain:

```typescript
// Example: Transfer 1 ETH
Transfer 1 ETH to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e
```

### 2. Bridge

Bridge tokens between different chains using LiFi:

```typescript
// Example: Bridge ETH from Ethereum to Base
Bridge 1 ETH from Ethereum to Base
```

### 3. Swap

Swap tokens on the same chain using LiFi:

```typescript
// Example: Swap ETH for USDC
Swap 1 ETH for USDC on Base
```
