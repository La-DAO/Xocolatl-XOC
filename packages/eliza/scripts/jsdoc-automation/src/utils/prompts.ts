    Base your response on the following package and code information:

    Package Information:
    - Name: ${packageJson.name}
    - Description: ${packageJson.description || "N/A"}

    Code Components:
    ${docs.classes.length > 0 ? `
    Classes:
    ${docs.classes.map((c) => `- ${c.name}: ${c.jsDoc}`).join("\n")}` : ""}

    ${docs.interfaces.length > 0 ? `
    Interfaces:
    ${docs.interfaces.map((i) => `- ${i.name}: ${i.jsDoc}`).join("\n")}` : ""}

    ${docs.types.length > 0 ? `
    Types:
    ${docs.types.map((t) => `- ${t.name}: ${t.jsDoc}`).join("\n")}` : ""}

    ${docs.functions.length > 0 ? `

    ${docs.variables.length > 0 ? `
    Variables:
    ${docs.variables.map((v) => `- ${v.name}: ${v.jsDoc}`).join("\n")}` : ""}

    Based on the above components, generate:
    1. A comprehensive overview that explains the plugin's purpose and key features
    2. FAQ entries that cover the following aspects of the code:
       - Action questions: Can the Action do this?
       - Capability questions: For example, Can the Action, Provider, or Evaluator do this in its current state?
       - Integration questions: For example, How to extend this aspect of the code?
       - Common use-case questions: For example, How do I accomplish specific tasks with the code as it stands today?
    3. Troubleshooting guide that anticipates potential issues based on the code structure

    Always include one FAQ pair that states:
        Q: "My action is registered, but the agent is not calling it"
        A: "Ensure that action's name clearly aligns with the task, and ensure you give a detailed description of the conditions that should trigger the action"

    Heres some content from this codebases documentation to help you provide a more accurate Overview, FAQ, and Troubleshooting:

    Providers are core modules that inject dynamic context and real-time information into agent interactions. They serve as a bridge between the agent and various external systems, enabling access to market data, wallet information, sentiment analysis, and temporal context.
        Overview
        A provider's primary purpose is to:
        Supply dynamic contextual information
        Integrate with the agent runtime
        Format information for conversation templates
        Maintain consistent data access

    Actions are core building blocks in Eliza that define how agents respond to and interact with messages. They allow agents to interact with external systems, modify their behavior, and perform tasks beyond simple message responses.
        Overview
        Each Action consists of:
        name: Unique identifier for the action
        similes: Array of alternative names/variations
        description: Detailed explanation of the action's purpose
        validate: Function that checks if action is appropriate
        handler: Implementation of the action's behavior
        examples: Array of example usage patterns

    Evaluators are core components that assess and extract information from conversations. They integrate with the AgentRuntime's evaluation system.
        Overview
        Evaluators enable agents to:
        Build long-term memory
        Track goal progress
        Extract facts and insights
        Maintain contextual awareness


    Create your FAQ and Troubleshooting based on likely questions and issues that users will have based on the documentation provided above.
    Format the response as a valid JSON object. For the FAQ try and have at least 5-6 questions and answers.

    IMPORTANT: Return only the raw JSON object without any markdown formatting or code blocks.
