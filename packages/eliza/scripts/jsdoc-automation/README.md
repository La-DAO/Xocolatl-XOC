# Codebase Documentation

- https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1110

## Set up

- Set GH_PAT & OPENAI_API_KEY in github actions as env variables

## Summary

- To only scan files in a PR, ensure the files have been merged into the base branch (defaults to develop), and provide the PR number in the github Action input
- `root_directory` is still enforced when scanning a PR
- To scan a provided directory set `root_directory` and leave the PR number empty

## GitHub Workflow Automation

The codebase includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`JSDoc Automation`) that allows triggering the documentation generation process with custom parameters. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory.

# Workflow Dispatch Inputs

The workflow can be triggered manually using the `workflow_dispatch` event, which accepts the following inputs:

- `pull_number` (optional): The pull request number to generate documentation for.

    - if not provided, the `root_directory` will be scanned
    - PR must be merged to develop/main branch

- `root_directory` (required): Only scans files in this directory.

    - Description: Target directory relative to repository root (e.g., packages/core/src)
    - Default: `packages/core/src/test_resources` - arbitrarily chose this because its small

- `excluded_directories` (required): Directories to exclude from scanning.

    - Description: Comma-separated list of directories to exclude, relative to root_directory
    - Default: 'node_modules,dist,test'

- `reviewers` (required): Pull Request Reviewers.
    - Description: Comma-separated list of GitHub usernames
    - Default: ''

### Config File

The `src/Configuration.ts` handles configuration loading from environment variables with fallback to YAML workflow files.

#### Default Values

- **Repository**: elizaOS/eliza
- **Branch**: develop
- **Commit Message**: "Generated JSDoc comments"
- **PR Title**: "JSDoc Generation"
- **PR Description**: "Automated JSDoc generation for the codebase"
- **PR Labels**: ["documentation", "automated-pr"]
- **Excluded Directories**: ["node_modules", "dist", "test"]
- **Excluded Files**: ["index.d.ts"]

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be added to the GitHub repository secrets:

- `GH_PAT`: Personal Access Token with sufficient permissions to create branches, commit changes, and create pull requests in the repository.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for accessing the OpenAI chat API used by the `AIService` to generate comments.

# Codebase Documentation

## `JsDocGenerator` Class

The `JsDocGenerator` class is responsible for generating JSDoc comments for code snippets and classes. It uses the `AIService` to generate comments based on the code provided.

## `TypeScriptFileIdentifier` Class

The `TypeScriptFileIdentifier` class handles identifying and retrieving TypeScript files from a specified directory. It checks file extensions to determine if a file is a TypeScript file.

## `TypeScriptParser` Class

The `TypeScriptParser` class parses TypeScript files using the `@typescript-eslint/parser`. It generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the parsed content.

## `DocumentationGenerator` Class

The `DocumentationGenerator` class orchestrates the generation of JSDoc documentation for a codebase. It traverses the directory, identifies TypeScript files, parses them, analyzes existing JSDoc comments, generates missing comments using the `JsDocGenerator`, and updates the files with the generated documentation. It also handles creating git branches, committing changes, and creating pull requests.

## `JsDocAnalyzer` Class

The `JsDocAnalyzer` class analyzes JSDoc comments in TypeScript code. It traverses the AST and identifies nodes that should have JSDoc comments. It also provides methods to check if a node is a class node and retrieve JSDoc comments associated with a node.

## `AIService` Class

The `AIService` class is a service for interacting with the OpenAI chat API. It uses the `ChatOpenAI` class from the `@langchain/openai` package to generate comments based on provided prompts.

## `DirectoryTraversal` Class

The `DirectoryTraversal` class handles traversing directories and files. It can traverse based on provided PR files or scan all files in a root directory. It filters files based on excluded directories and file extensions.

## `GitManager` Class

The `GitManager` class manages operations related to interacting with a Git repository using the GitHub API. It can retrieve files in a pull request, create branches, commit files, and create pull requests.

## `Configuration` Class

The `Configuration` class represents a configuration object that holds various settings for a project. It can load configuration data from a JSON file and save the current configuration data to a file.

## `Main` Function

The `main` function is the entry point of the documentation generation process. It creates instances of necessary classes, loads the configuration, retrieves files from a pull request if specified, traverses the directory, parses TypeScript files, analyzes JSDoc comments, and generates documentation using the `DocumentationGenerator`. It also handles error logging.
